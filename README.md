how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
16

## Self-Reflection:
I liked this lab, though I wish there was more instcruction on setting up Phaser, I've tried like 4 different methods but nothing seems to work for me, I still did all the material though and learned a lot, just wish I was able to see the fruits of my labor

### How long it took me to finish this?
without doing phaser stuff, I say 2 and a half hours, with all the phaser stuff I would say 4 and a half hours.
